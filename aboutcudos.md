## What is CUDOS about? 

CUDOS is a support group based at Coventry University and place of discussion for how you can incorporate Open Science practices in your research. One of the main barriers to incorporating these practices is a lack of knowledge or support. For example, if you, your supervisors, or your collaborators do not have any experience sharing your analysis scripts, you may feel hesitant to try it out. Even though we learn from making mistakes, no one actually likes making them, so perhaps if someone could show you how it can be done, you would be more willing to adopt Open Science practices. 

## Who is CUDOS for? 

This group is open to anyone at any career stage who is interested in incorporating Open Science practices into their research. You could be a third year undergraduate student wanting to adopt these practices early. You could be a PhD student and want to incorporate Open Science practices throughout your thesis. You could even be a Reader who has vast amounts of experience in conducting research, but you want to slightly change your current workflow. This group is intended to be open to any career stage and aims to bring people together so that they can learn from each other. 

## What are Open Science practices? 

- Pre-registering the methodology of your study before you collect data. You could even submit your study as a [Registered Report](https://cos.io/rr/) which is even possible as a [graduate student](http://blog.efpsa.org/2016/09/09/publishing-a-registered-report-as-a-postgraduate-researcher/).

- Sharing your materials to make it easier for others to replicate your study.

- Sharing your data (unless there are ethical reasons not to) and analysis scripts to make it easier for others to reproduce the findings of your study.

- Sharing your manuscripts as a [pre-print](http://blog.psyarxiv.com/about-psyarxiv/) or publish your article [Open Access](http://libguides.coventry.ac.uk/rsp/openaccess) to enable unrestricted access to your research.

- Sign your peer reviews and support initiatives such as [PRO](https://opennessinitiative.org/).

- Produce open educational materials to train other scientists.

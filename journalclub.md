## The format of journal club
Journal club will aim to run monthly to allow you enough time to read the article before attending. The next paper will be announced at the end of each journal club after a vote on which article everyone would like to cover next. A copy of the paper will then be made available to everyone. 

The idea is to read the paper before attending journal club so that we can focus on discussing the implications of the paper, any pros and cons, and how it can be incorporated into your own research practices. During the workshop, we will take notes to record peopleâ€™s thoughts and create a general summary of the paper. These will then be shared on this page where further comments can be made, and people who struggle to attend physically can engage with the article.  

## Why are we focusing on statistics and research methods?
Unless you are a part of a specialised research group, it is likely that your research interests may be different to your fellow researchers. However, the common denominator in psychological research is the methods used to make inferences (the emphasis is on statistics, but qualitative methods are welcome). Furthermore, statistics and research methods is itself an active area of development, and there are regularly new methods and insights found that could impact how you conduct research. The aim of this journal club is to discuss current advances in research methods to broaden your statistical horizons. If you know of a new research paper or a classic that should be revisited, add it to the [list of articles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WfGjtFpbc9uiS64nEHWbFwJQFP0m1jcUy3vnzFGZoEE/edit?usp=sharing) we can cover, and we can vote on what paper is covered in the next journal club.
